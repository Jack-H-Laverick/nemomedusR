#' Summarise Across Depths in a NEMO-MEDUSA Array
#'
#' This function takes an array of a variable, and an array of water thicknesses to perform a weighted average across depth. The depth
#' window to be averaged can be specified, so this function can be used to create both shallow and deep layers (or more for that matter).
#'
#' @param data An array containing estimates of a variable.
#' @param depth A TRUE FALSE vector indicating the depth layers to be extracted.
#' @param weights An array containing water thicknesses.
#' @return A matrix containing the weighted averages of the variable across the depth window of interest.

#' Check Whether a Vector Contains Data
#'
#' This function provides a check for whether a vector of locations contains any data. This is useful

#' sea floor at those coordinates is shallower than the maximum depth we set for the shallow zone.

#' @param x A vector of values to check.

#' Calculate Water Layer Thicknesses Within an Array
#'
#' This function calculates the thickness of the water layer around each point in a NEMO-MEDUSA array. These thicknesses
#' are needed to calculate weighted averages across a depth window.
#'
#' The function starts by calculating the thickness of the depth window represented by the shallowest layer in the array.
#' This is the depth to halfway between the shallowest and the next layer, subtracting any depth to the top of the window, i.e.
#' If the top of the window is the sea surface, the first array layer is at 5m, and the second is at 10m, the water thickness about
#' the first point is 7.5m (mean(5, 10) - 0). The function then checks whether the depth of this layer of points is shallower than the depth
#' to the seafloor for any of the points. For these points which exist below the seafloor, thicknesses are replaced by the depth to the seafloor,
#' minus the depth to the top of the depth window.
#'
#' The function then populates the thicknesses of the mid-layers in a for-loop, working increasingly deeper. The thickness about a point is
#' calculated as the difference between the depth halfway to the point above, and the depth halfway to the point below. Checks and replacements
#' are performed, as explained above, to see whether any points are now beyond the limit of the bathymetry, or approaching the `top` or
#' `bottom` of the depth window. If they are, the claculations are performed again using the new max and min depths.
#'
#' The thicknesses for the deepest layer of points are calculated as the depth to the seafloor minus the mid-depth of the deepest two layers.
#'
#' If a weight is <= 0, it is replaced with NA as this indicates land.
#'
#' @param top The shallowest depth in the depth window.
#' @param bottom The deepest depth in the depth window.
#' @return An array of water layer thicknesses to match the dimensions of a NEMO-MEDUSA array.
