#' Prepare for Averaging by Decade
#'
#' This function cleans the saved NEMO-MEDUSA monthly summaries, for averaging into decades.
#'
#' @param saved A dataframe containing a summarised month from NEMO-MEDUSA model outputs.
#' @return A dataframe containing a summarised month of NEMO-MEDUSA output, gaining a decade column, and dropping columns
#' which aren't needed for spatial maps.
#' @family NEMO-MEDUSA averages
#' @export

#' Strip Snow and Ice Variables at Depth
#'
#' This function removes the snow and ice columns from a dataframe if depth = "D".
#'
#' Some variables are only relevant in the shallow zone of StrathE2E polar. There is no sea-ice 60 m under the sea.
#' This means, when dataframes containing both shallow and deep data are split by depth, empty columns can be introduced.
#' These empty columns can cause problems in downstream functions, such as plotting by column. This function removes the
#' empty columns.
#'
#' @param data A dataframe containing a summarised month from NEMO-MEDUSA model outputs, at a single depth.
#' @param dt Switch for using either data.table or dplyr methods (TRUE/FALSE respectively)
#' @return If the `data` contains shallow data, no action is taken. If `data` contains deep data, columns for variables only
#' relevant in the shallow zone are dropped.
#' @family NEMO-MEDUSA averages
#' @export

#' Average into Decadal Grids
#'
#' This function averages cleaned NEMO-MEDUSA monthly summaries into decadal grids.
#'
#' The function groups by all spatial variables (Longitude, Latitude, Depth, and Shore zone), and by decade and month.
#' The mean for every other variable is calculated within these groups.
#'
#' @param saved A dataframe containing a summarised month from NEMO-MEDUSA model outputs. It must contain the columns:
#' Longitude, Latitude, Decade, Month, Shore, and Depth.
#' @param dt Switch for using either data.table or dplyr methods (TRUE/FALSE respectively)
#' @return A dataframe containing a summarised decade of spatialy resolved NEMO-MEDUSA outputs.
