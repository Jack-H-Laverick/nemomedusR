nemomedusR is an R package for creating common spatial and temporal summaries of NEMO-MEDUSA model output. The functions contained in this package streamline the process of sampling along transects, within volumes, and across depths. The functions balance processing speed against memory load so a standard laptop should be able to perform these operations. 

<br/>

Typically the amount of data in memory at any one time is small enough to allow files to be processed in parallel. When tested at the University of Strathclyde the limit on speed was accessing data files from the server, instead of processing time of each file. The largest effect you can have on speed as an end user is likely where you choose to store the NEMO-MEDUSA model output relative to the machine running R.

## Installation

The internal facing / development version can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
