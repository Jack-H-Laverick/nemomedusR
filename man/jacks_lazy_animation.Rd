\title{Animate a map of GFW data for a geartype, above a minimum level of fishing activity}
\usage{
jacks_lazy_animation(gear, limit)
}
\arguments{
\item{gear}{The gear type used by boats to be mapped.}

\item{limit}{The minimum number of hours of fishing activity required for a pixel to be included in the map.}
}
\value{
